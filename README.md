## Initial set up
To prepare this project to run, you'll need to have nodejs `v6.1.0` or `up` installed in your computer.
I suggest to use [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)  in order to install node and manage diference version easily.

Run `nvm use`.

Install [editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/) to keep end lines consistent between editor.

You will also need gulp to run the application, needs to be installed globally. run `npm i -g gulp`. Depending on your local configuration, you might need run this command with `sudo`.

Once you have everything installed, run `npm install` inside the project folder. This is just for the first time, and what it does is download all the packages it needs to run.

## Running the project

To run the project simple navigate to the project folder, and run `gulp`. It will compile all the assets and start a new web server in the [9000](http://localhost:9000/) port.

## Project structure
All the necessary code is inside the `_src_` folder, but for a better understanding, here's a description of each one:

```

```

# How to include more sizes
- Stop gulp
- Copy and paste one of the existing banner that are inside of the _bannerlist_ folder.
- Change only the size from the folder name to keep name convetion

## 1-What if you need jQuery
This Boilerplate for the banners already have included a Tiny JavaScript DOM query library
called JQlite for more info visit the follow link [JQlite](https://code.google.com/archive/p/jqlite/wikis/UsingJQLite.wiki)
its included in the plugin.js file.

```
│   │   ├── js/
│   │   │   └── main.js
│   │   │   └── plugin.js * Line 2 to line 433

```

Note: If you want to use jquery library you must comment out those lines, will reduce the main.min.js file size an approximate to 6k.

Adding Jquery library to project:

Go to [CDN](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/jquery) and grab the link of the jquery version of you needs.
Then add it to the follow file:

```
│   ├── pug/
│   │   └── layout.pug

```

## What if you need another library
Please find a cdn for it and include in the `_src/pug/layout.pug_` file.

## Build
`gulp distribute`
